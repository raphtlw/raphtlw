### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught web and native developer. I love machine learning and data science, UI/UX development, designing, architecting, building apps, linux, docker and much more.

TL;DR: I love making cool shit.

Most of my projects are open source, like [coronastats](https://github.com/raphtlw/coronastats), [symbit](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit) and [qscan](https://github.com/raphtlw/qscan).

Occasionally, I listen to music, curate playlists and do DIY projects. Sometimes, I take photos and make videos.

Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/raphtlw) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/raphtlw).

If you want to do it the old fasioned way, I have an [email](mailto:raphpb1912@gmail.com) too.
